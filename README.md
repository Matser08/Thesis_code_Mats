# Thesis_code_Mats
In this repository one will be able to find all the code used in my thesis

The files that are used for method 1, where we use machine learning algorithms (Random forest classification and logistic regression), on the data 
without feature extraction, are: 

	Step 1 - Start_file_working_out_how_to_deal_with_the_data 

	Step 2 - Creating_2d_csv_per_participant

	Step 3 - creating_train_and_test_data_further

	Step 4 - code 


The files that are used for method 2, where we use machine learning algorithms (Random forest classification and logistic regression) on the data 
with feature extraction, are:

	step 1 - WorkingCode_Morlet_Wavelet_Transform_and_Baseline, code for applying the morlet wavelet frequency in Fieldtrip, 
	which is adapted from code provided in the dataset that is the basis of my thesis (Gregory et al., 2021). The original code of 
	from the database has been added as Analysis_MatlabScript_Fieldtrip. 

	Step 2 - Code_applying_wavelet_transform

	Step 3 - Feature_Ex_RandFor_LogReg


Finally, for plotting some graphs: 

	file - code for plotting graphs
