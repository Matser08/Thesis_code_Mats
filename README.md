In this repository one will be able to find all the code used in my thesis

The files that are used for method 1, where we use machine learning algorithms (Random forest classification and logistic regression), on the data 
without feature extraction, are: 
Step 1 - Start_file_working_out_how_to_deal_with_the_data
Step 2 - Creating_2d_csv_per_participant
Step 3 - creating_train_and_test_data_further
Step 4 - code 

The files that are used for method 2, where we use machine learning algorithms (Random forest classification and logistic regression) on the data 
with feature extraction, are:
Step 1: - Code_applying_wavelet_transform
Step 2: - Feature_Ex_RandFor_LogReg

Finally, for plotting some graphs: 
file: -code for plotting graphs
